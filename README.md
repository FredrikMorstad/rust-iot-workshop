# rust-iot-workshop ðŸ¦€

In this workshop we will create a "smart" humidity and temperature sensor. The goal is to become familiar with some embedded programming in rust on ESP controllers.

## Project

todo!

## Part 0: Setup

To participate in this workshop you need three components: A esp microcontroller, a DHT sensor and a breadboard pluss wires.

#### 1. Controllers

We have two types of esp controllers to use, either the ESP32 D1 or ESP3286

#### 2. DHT-22 sensor

#### Setup development environment

To build and upload our application onto a esp board we need to generate our project for our chip and some tooling. First we need to setup esp on our pc:

<details>
<summary> Setup esp on your computer ðŸ’» </summary>
To be able to work with our esp controller we need to setup our development environment. Esp has a [official book](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/introduction.html) which explains how to work with esp controllers with rust

### Prerequisites

To run application with standard library(std) we need ldproxy.

> [!TIP]
> If you have [cargo binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) installed, you can use `cargo binstall <program>` for the commands below to avoid having to compile the projects

```
cargo install ldproxy
```

### Setup tooling for RISC-V and Xtensa Targets

This setup is also described in the book [here](https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/installation/riscv-and-xtensa.html). So feel free to check it out for a more detail description of the tooling. Setting up the tooling is a three step process:

1. Install espup

```
cargo install espup
```

2. Install dependencies

```
espup install
```

Run:

```
brew install cmake ninja dfu-util
```

Install `espflash` to allow flashing data to the controller:

```
cargo install cargo-espflash
```

3. Setup environment variables
   ESP uses some specific environment variables when building the project, these values need to be exported via the export script downloaded by espup. To avoid having to run this command

```
. $HOME/export-esp.sh
```

each time we need change project I recommend adding a alias to your rc file. By adding this line to our rc file

```
alias get_idf='. $HOME/export-esp.sh'
```

we can run `get_idf` befor building a different esp project. Remember to source the shell after updating your rc file.

4.

<br>
Once esp is setup on our computer we can try to build and run the project on our controller. I have created a template project called `dht-sensor`, run `cd dht-sensor` to move into the project and run it using: <br >

```
cargo run
```

(If you get a choice between tty and cu, choose tty)

If everything worked, you should get the following output:

_If you got stuck at "Connecting...", hit the reset-button on the controller_

## Part 1: Getting data from the sensor (using lib)

The first challenge is to create a program that reads sensor values at an interval. The first ting we need to so is
The first thing we need to do wire our sensor and controller on the breadboard correctly. Once that is done we can driver

<details>
<summary>Solution ðŸ’¡</summary>

```rust
use std::{thread::sleep, time::Duration};

use embedded_dht_rs::dht22::Dht22;
use esp_idf_svc::hal::{delay::Delay, gpio::PinDriver, prelude::Peripherals};

fn main() {
    // It is necessary to call this function once. Otherwise some patches to the runtime
    // implemented by esp-idf-sys might not link properly. See https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template/issues/71
    esp_idf_svc::sys::link_patches();

    // Bind the log crate to the ESP Logging facilities
    esp_idf_svc::log::EspLogger::initialize_default();

    let peripherals = Peripherals::take().unwrap();

    let delay = Delay::new(1000);

    let pin = PinDriver::input_output_od(peripherals.pins.gpio4).unwrap();

    let mut sensor = Dht22::new(pin, delay);

    loop {
        match sensor.read() {
            Ok(reading) => {
                println!("{}Â°C, {}% RH", reading.temperature, reading.humidity)
            }
            Err(e) => eprintln!("Error: {:?}", e),
        }

        sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
    }
}
```

## Part 2: Writing our own "driver"

## Part 3: Running our web server

## Part 4: Get measurements from server

## Part 5: (Optional) Measurements SSE?
